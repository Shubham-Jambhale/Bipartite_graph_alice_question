# Question 

Alice is fond of painting with blue and red colors.She was given a graph with vertices and edges
and her task is to paint the vertices with favorite two colors such that adjacent vertices do not
have the same color.

Write a program which takes the graph as adjacency matrix and returns true if Alice succeeds
else false

# Example 

adj_matrix = [[0,1,1,0], [1,0,0,1], [1,0,0,1],[0, 1, 1, 0]]

output = True
